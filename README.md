# MeeusMoon

A Windows application to visualize and compute Moon phases, eclipses, and astronomical events using algorithms from Jean Meeus' classic book *Astronomical Formulae for Calculators*.

## üåï Overview

This repository archives the development and executables of a C++ MFC-based program that:

- Draws the current phase of the Moon in a resizable window.
- Computes solar and lunar events such as rise/set times, twilight, eclipses, and seasonal markers.
- Updates detailed logs in text files for real-time astronomical insights.
- Includes a command-line utility for advanced Moon calculations (`MMoon.exe`).

All astronomical computations are based on formulas from Jean Meeus' book (*astronomical-formulae.pdf*, included), with expected accuracy within 2‚Äì3 minutes.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Run the Application

1. Extract `MeeusMoon.zip` (from the root of the archive) into a folder like `C:\Astronomy\MeeusMoon\`.
2. Run `MoonPhase.exe`.
3. Resize or minimize the window ‚Äî the display updates Moon phases in real time.

**Features shown in the window:**

- Current Moon phase and illumination.
- Apparent Moon size compared to the Sun.
- Eclipse possibility indicators:
  - Blue dotted lines: min/max Moon sizes
  - Grey dotted line: average Moon size
  - Yellow line: Sun's size
- Real-time logs written to:
  - `actual.txt`: Daily info (rise/set times, eclipses, solstices, etc.)
  - `daily.txt`: Daily logs
  - `yearly.txt`: Annual summaries

**Customize your location and time zone** in `place.txt` (only the first line is used; Burgess Hill is set by default).

**Extra info:**  
Click the top-left corner ‚Üí **About Moon Phase** to view:
- Fraction illuminated (0.00 = New Moon, 1.00 = Full Moon)
- Bright limb angle
- Apparent diameters:
  - Moon
  - Sun
  - Difference
  - Comparison to min/max Moon size

### Command-Line Utility: `MMoon.exe`

Use `MMoon.exe` from the console to compute Moon data programmatically.

**Usage:**

```

MMoon.exe \[-d] \[-k] \[-S] \[-P] < inputfile > outputfile

```

Great for scripting, automation, and scientific calculations.

## üîß Building from Source

To build the full project, use **Microsoft Visual Studio 2022**.

### Step-by-step:

1. Build the static library:
```

Projects\CC++\Astronomy\Meeus\Meeus.sln

```

2. Build both executables:
```

Projects\CC++\Astronomy\MMoon\MMoon.sln
Projects\CC++\Astronomy\MoonPhase\MoonPhase.sln

```

**Output folders:**
- `Meeus.lib` ‚Üí in `x64\Release\`
- `MMoon.exe` ‚Üí in `x64\Release\`
- `MoonPhase.exe` ‚Üí in `x64\Release\`

## üåå Extending the Software

The software is modular. You can extend it with other celestial objects (e.g. stars, planets) via a C++ abstract base class.

### To add a new celestial object:

1. Inherit from the abstract celestial class.
2. Implement two pure virtual methods:
- One to compute the object's position.
- One to compute its apparent semi-diameter.

Once implemented, your object will automatically support:
- Rise and set time calculations
- Horizon detection
- Size comparisons

**Example:**  
- The star **Pollux** is included as a simple reference.
- Planets can be added by following the same model as the Moon, using formulas from the Meeus book.
